Package main defines -
    This is going to be a standalone executable program, rather than a shared library.
    It is our program entrypoint.

Go is Case-Sensitive

// line comment
/* block 
comment */

Short Assignments (like a:= 10) can be used with the function only and you have to use them
    all otherwise you'll get an error.
    Go support type inference

Functions enables to us to write clean, tidy, modular code.
    return keyword exits a function.

    main() : called automatically, doesn't take any parameters, doesn't return any values,
             signature is simple

             When you don't know how many values are going to be passed in a function use
             Variadic Functions
