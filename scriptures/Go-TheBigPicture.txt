Characteristics -
    Strong, Static type system :
        Static typed programming languages are those in which variables need not be defined before 
        they're used. 
    C-inspired system
    Multi Paradigm - Procedural, OOP
    Garbage Collected
    Fully Compiled
    Rapid Compilation
    Single binary output

What is Go -
    Developed by : Google : Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, Robert Griesemer
    Problem to address : Efficient Compilation, Execution and Ease of programming

Philosophy and Values -
    Simplicity : 

    Network aware and Concurrent apps : net and net/http packages : Create web server using
                                                                    only standard library
                                        goroutines : Concurrency : Minimal resources
                                        Scheduler : keep tracks of all goroutines
                                        channels : to communicate between multiple Concurrent
                                                   tasks (goroutines).
    
    Out-of-the box Experience : Standard library : Testing, Networking APIs, File and String
                                                   Manipulation, Data Compression.
                                Go Cli : Project Intialization, Build, Code Generation.
                                         Retrive Dependencies, Test, Profiling,
                                         Documentation, Report language Bugs
    
    Cross Platform : 
    
    Backward Compatibility : Exception : Security, Unspecified Behaviour, Specification Error,
                                         Bugs
